    "\n",
    "A running mean time series is a filter that can be applied to smooth a given signal. For this case, a given point $y_{t}$ is equal to the average of its neighbour points. This can be expressed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{1} = \\dfrac{1}{2k+1} \\sum_{i=t-k}^{t+k}x_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This filter smoothes the sharp edges and the larger the value of k, the smoother the signal becomes. Unfortunately, this produces *edge effects* for the first and last signal points. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally appropriate when the noise is evenly (positively and negatively) distributed."
